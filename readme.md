## Instructions

Write a working test that, starting from this page (https://www.justgiving.com/4w350m3/donation/direct/charity/2050), goes through the donation process and verifies that, after various steps, you end up on the page shown in the  screenshot in the solution.

Please do not make an actual donation, in other words don't make your test click on the "Donate now" button in the final step.

We are interested in seeing your approach to writing well-structured, extensbile and maintainable UI tests.

Try to timebox this to 3 hours if you can. However, it's important that you are happy with the approach you have been able to illustrate.

Please DO NOT fork this project on Github, as we want to be sure candidates' test submissions are original.

We require you to forward the link to a cloud-based solution as zip files won’t get through our firewall.

You will need Visual Studio installed to be able to undertake the challenge. Using Visual Studio and C# is recommended. If not possible, the second preferred choice is completing it in Java. Alternatively, use a language of your choice.
